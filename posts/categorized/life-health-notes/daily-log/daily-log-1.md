Okay, so I'm not going to say I'm addicted to porn but it takes precedent over things in my life. 

Like I'll watch porn for like 90 minutes 

I also want to make like an excuses list, like I have an alotted time to work out and work on my stuff but I just don't make it and some of the excuses are like, my spine hurt so I didn't squat. 

I also want to make this excuse list dignified viz. not try to shame anyone, like actually get excuses.

Woke up at 2am tried to go back to bed couldn't, 
Got 5 hours of real sleep according to FitBit

How I feel during this time, I wake up with a stuffy nose and my adrenaline up, it seems I can't a good night's rest unless I take the sleep aid pills and take two of them.

I'm not really doing this all that well so it would probably be better to do it thru a web app instead.
