title: "I cannot get a affordable handheld which runs Linux REALLY well and
  powerful enough for my Technologist tasks.  "
how does it inconvience you: I want to be in bed and code or on the coach and
  code or in the car and code or on the place and code, and laptops aren't all
  that portable compared to a PSP.
what have you done as a workaround: "There are GPD work arounds but they're too
  expensive and they aren't meant for my use case. Also they're prohibitively
  expensive, and they take up too much battery which can defeat the point of its
  portability factor. "
how does this pain point limit what you want to do: "I am limited by options on
  the market. I would have to build my own which I would never do in my current
  circumstance cuz I'm not qualified. "
on a scale of 1 - 10 how badly would you want the solution to your paint point: 8
how much progress have the tech you or someone you're working has gone to fixing the pain point: 4
