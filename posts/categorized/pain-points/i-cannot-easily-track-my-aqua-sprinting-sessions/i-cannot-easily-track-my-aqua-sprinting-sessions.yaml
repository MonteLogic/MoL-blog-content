title: I cannot easily track my Aqua Sprinting sessions
how does it inconvience you: "Because if I want to know how fast/slow I'm going
  I'm going to have to guess also I can't show progress. "
what have you done as a workaround: >-
  I have just been going fast and hoping I'm at a good cadence. 


  What could be an easy workaround is to just record yourself and then add that
  to some Neural Network and that could track it but I don't feel like putting
  my Smartphone under water. 
how does this pain point limit what you want to do: "Lack of knowledge on
  wearables also, the underwater tech isn't there for  this. "
on a scale of 1 - 10 how badly would you want the solution to your paint point: 8
how much progress have the tech you or someone you're working has gone to fixing the pain point: 0
