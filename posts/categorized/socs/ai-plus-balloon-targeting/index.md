I feel as if the best solution would be a box which just launched a couple of wired drones covertly. 


It would use balloons, drop the care package and just wait for the right time to come out. 


So instead of having user control reliant upon SpaceX it would just AI targeting to hone in on military targets. 


I don't think Starlink would be good for this not because it isn't a capable but because the rug could be snatched from under our feet, STS.
