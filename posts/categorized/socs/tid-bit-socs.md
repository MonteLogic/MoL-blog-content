It's like a really good skill to make simple solutions which JUST GET THE JOB done instead of making some 'future' complicated, troubleshooted solution.

... 

I think that there should be like a named way of doing indie-hacking. 

Like the MoL99 style. 
Where, my style is you off load AS MUCH of the non-flagship functionality to third parties, don't use dbs at ALL. Rely on Clerk or very similar service and use that metadata as db values. Also use JSON file a lot for managing complex logic.  
It should also be like at the time when they were deving rather than the PERSON forever because styles can change. 



... 

I think the style right now is to view the whole project view Gemini and use Cursor to implement features. 


...

I like cursor it's something to keep you eye on but it's just a better advancement of the problem of not getting enough 'design vision' in order to make it work.
