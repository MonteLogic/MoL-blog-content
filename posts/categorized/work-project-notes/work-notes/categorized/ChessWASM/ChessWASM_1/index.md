ChessWASM.

I am no longer using Cursor because at the end of the day it makes you stupid and I spent a whole entire day the other day learning only about 30 minutes but spent like 6 hours 'vibe coding'.

Issues with my ChessWASM:
SharedArrayBuffer


This might be an issue but right now we're going with Next.js and Rust for the building and scaffolding of all of our Rust stuff. 


...

Okay so I'm going to make a MoMegaTemplate PWA for my Next.js make it a tagged branch then get that tagged branch and turn that into ChessPlusNext.

Okay, so long term we have to make it like:
https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app

I guess I have to study how they are generating the templates whether that be create-t3-app or epicweb-dev/epic-stack

Okay, so we have to get it so there isn't any whitespace showing. 

Also, that game status stuff that can be done away wtih.

After all that, we have to make the board max size.

Okay, so we have to make it so, 

Because space is a constraint I think I'm going to have an external API which will just already have positions and I'll run a GET on it and then the user can just highlight if this one is their favorite or not.
