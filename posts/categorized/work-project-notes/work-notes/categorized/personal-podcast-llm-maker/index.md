## Start: 



I think I'm going to start off with the stack I'm already used to and just add in stuff. 


I'm going to integrate in that Next.js chatbot.



gh repo clone vercel/ai-chatbot

It's being done here but I'm not seeing where it's suited to a certain individual.

I like this notebookLLM stuff but you have to make a notebook and all that stuff which I haven't made.

Ideally, it could use other sources like your codebases, Spotify books or just quiz on you on material and fill you in on what you don't know.

I wonder for those chatbot arenas there could be a way where you say, this convo is failing, lets export it/ put it in the stumped box.
