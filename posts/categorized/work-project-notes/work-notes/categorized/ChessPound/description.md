A project to do Chess training realtime, ALERTS when you blunder. 

The end goal is to have it run on some AMD EPYC processor or (supercomputer\* ).


Also, I feel like there should be a timing protocol to emualte human play. So if you tried to trap them, they would wait. 

i.e.
It should run 5|5 and FEEL like you're playing a player
