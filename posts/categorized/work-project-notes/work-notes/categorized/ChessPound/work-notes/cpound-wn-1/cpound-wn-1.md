I REALLY don't want to create a custom state system.


Okay, to make the green and red alerts than what we have to do is have it be really fast, which is a justification for having it be Linux desktop. 

We also want to make it WASM because that may make it faster for running the Chess evals.

What I want to do is... 


Really on the MoLStack side I would like a way to play like an audio file here.


And play it but from this nvim instance and not have to add a bunch of utils to the terminal to make it work.


What I realized why .NET is dope esp. Avalonia because it is really good at cross-platform apps and I'm a Linux user and the main drawback of Linux is compatabillity and things just not working out of the box. 

You know what they say, Linux is free if you don't value your time. 




It could be like, Sicillian vs. King's Indian or what have you.

I want to get focused on the business logic viz. the part of the game I WANT. This part is practicing middle game positions.

I think today marks the day where we've reached the point of critical mass and vibe coding no longer works.

I'm tryna get my Cursor IDE to detect .NET/C# errors. 

Okay so I fixed that.


Aside: 

I would like to just ctrl+alt+t write my GH Issue down and then take that buffer of the Vim instance.

So I have to make it like a custom implementaion for WASM because there isn't a stack which exists which can just talk to a WASM container without a JavaScript bridge. 


...

I would like to study how LiChess does their bots and how they run it.

I feel like the Legacy Chess Companies aren't using Server Side WASM.
