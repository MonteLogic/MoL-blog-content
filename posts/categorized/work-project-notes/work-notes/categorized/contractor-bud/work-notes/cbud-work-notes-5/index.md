## Start: Sun Jul 13 2025 13:20:06 CDT

Okay, updating to Next.js 15.3 

I noticed I have a lot of dependencies which are being used, I think I am adding all of these deps because I am coming up with very technical solutions, basically a lot of workarounds which is fine but we should refactor to reduce complexity using prescribed solutions rather than coming up with intricate solutions. 


...
Like really for this starter page, it shouldn't even go to a different page or load a page, they just press the button and immediately the flagship slider comes up. 



Recognized device, sign in to your account? This will make the non-authed user accessing the flagship find his account and place easier.


## New Feature(?)

Also, when you click on a node I feel like another modal should pop up and it'll describe what's going on.


## Save Changes should have a loading spinner.

There should be a loading spinner also I REALLY like the way PostHog's button feel like when you click them so when you click them there should be sort of a 'tactile' feedback.

## Get Traffic

I could hire blogs to send me traffic as I don't think there's a lot of way to monetize Post Office Contractors. 



Really, I think the market should cater to delivery drivers who are independent and want the same functionality as bigger companies.
