## Start: Sun May 11 2025 12:39:24 CDT

Attempting:
https://github.com/Expensify/App/issues/61644

So, I'm going to build/run the app; of these platforms.

Android: App

Android: mWeb Chrome

iOS: App

iOS: mWeb Safari

iOS: mWeb Chrome

Windows: Chrome

MacOS: Chrome / Safari

MacOS: Desktop

The ones which I have the easiest access to is going to be Android app and Android mWeb Chrome.

....

I'm just going to use Chrome on my Linux and target the emulator in dev tools rather than using a virtual device as it's just WAY too slow.

But I will still use this for debugging the Android platform as well as testing purposes.

But I will do the bulk of my work on Chrome for Linux with the Android target.

Aside: What I would like to do is to get really good content generated from Gemini and I could read that in the down time.

...

Okay, so what I noticed is the one I was looking at ALREADY has proposals and some of them have like 3 or 4 of them and there are ones WITHOUT proposals so I'm going to get to working on THOSE.

So switching back to:
https://github.com/Expensify/App/issues/60144


Also, I don't see any responses critiquing the proposals it looks like they post the proposal and they only get a response if it gets accepted.
