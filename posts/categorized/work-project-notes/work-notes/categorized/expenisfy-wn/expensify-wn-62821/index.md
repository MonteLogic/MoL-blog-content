What happens when the Expense menu item is pressed 


React Dev Tools has been coming in clutch. 


I think its going to be MenuItemList 

function MenuItemList({menuItems = [], shouldUseSingleExecution = false, wrapperStyle = {}, icon = undefined, iconWidth = undefined, iconHeight = undefined}: MenuItemListProps) {

It IS SearchTypeMenu
