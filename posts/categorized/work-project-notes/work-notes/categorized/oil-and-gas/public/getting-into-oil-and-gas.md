I'm currently 1,600 USD in debt to my College, my plan is to get enough money to get out of debt and then re-enroll in that college to get my CDL and then get oil endorsements and then go back out into the oil field.

I would also say, you want get a VAN and customize it to be a sleeping arrangement but don't do too much with it.

I'm looking for financing options for the CDL A. 

I'm contacting a bunch of Trucker Training firms in my area and see if I can't get some financing done. 

These training facilities are not the entity which I owe money.
