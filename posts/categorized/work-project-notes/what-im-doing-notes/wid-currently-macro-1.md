## Now: Tue May 20 2025 16:56:07 CDT

Currently focusing on Expensify.

## Today: Wed May 21 2025 15:01:02 CDT -  Wed May 21 2025 17:01:02 CDT

Got Expensify to run on my local machine (2nd thinkpad) and I analyzed where a real PDF from CBud is generated wrote that down and imported some of the logic but didn't make meaningful changes.

Only worked 2 hours.


## Today: Fri May 23 2025 13:16:24 CDT - 

What I plan on: 

- I plan on creating a mock proposal for Expensify and implementing a solution 
- I plan on generating a PDF on MySiddur and getting into knowing how to make a somewhat useful Siddur. 

What I did: 

Just made a plain PDF when you hit generate siddur.

## Today:  Sun May 25 2025 08:54:32 CDT - 

I am going to spend 2.5 hours perusing the Expensify repo everyday. 

I submitted a proposal. 


## Today: Fri Jun 13 2025 15:41:42 CDT


So, I gotta fix that Siddur to make it usable for PDFs I also have to add a lot more notes to it. 

### Making Prayer Logs
Really I should be praying and saying what I'm doing and writing down if it was a Kosher prayer or not. 

REALLY, I should be making prayer logs. 


### As for Expensify

I got a debug tool with Replay.io so I will use the browser state to better write down Excalidraw flow diagrams. 


...

## For now on

Going to just check in on Expensify 


I am going to focus on my projects and make the 1.0s 


MySiddur and I would also like to make an app so I can measure my jump times and flys way better.

I would also like to blog more about pro-natalism 

On that pro-natalism tip, I would like to get the workaway thing going good viz. the plan of working 80+ hours with overtime with an employer with deep pockets, then at the end of the 6 months or however long you could get like 50k and then you take that down to one of the magic living zones and live like a Litvak.


Workaway - 
Get welding certs
Get nuclear work certs 

You need to break into the industry so you're going to need contacts.

Really, working 80 hours on your feet is tough so you might be better off trucking.

## Currently: Sun Jul 13 2025 11:45:08 CDT

I think I'm going to work on this profiler and work on tech/SaaS for the healthcare industry.

Note, there's a lot more women here so sales is going to be way easier.
