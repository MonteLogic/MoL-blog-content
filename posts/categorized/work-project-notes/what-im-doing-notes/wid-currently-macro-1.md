Got Expensify to run on my local machine (2nd thinkpad) and I analyzed where a real PDF from CBud is generated wrote that down and imported some of the logic but didn't make meaningful changes.

Only worked 2 hours.

What I plan on: 

- I plan on creating a mock proposal for Expensify and implementing a solution 
- I plan on generating a PDF on MySiddur and getting into knowing how to make a somewhat useful Siddur. 

What I did: 

Just made a plain PDF when you hit generate siddur.

## Today:  Sun May 25 2025 08:54:32 CDT - 

I am going to spend 2.5 hours perusing the Expensify repo everyday. 

I submitted a proposal.

So, I gotta fix that Siddur to make it usable for PDFs I also have to add a lot more notes to it. 

### Making Prayer Logs
Really I should be praying and saying what I'm doing and writing down if it was a Kosher prayer or not. 

REALLY, I should be making prayer logs. 


### As for Expensify

I got a debug tool with Replay.io so I will use the browser state to better write down Excalidraw flow diagrams.
