Got Expensify to run on my local machine (2nd thinkpad) and I analyzed where a real PDF from CBud is generated wrote that down and imported some of the logic but didn't make meaningful changes.

Only worked 2 hours.

What I plan on: 

- I plan on creating a mock proposal for Expensify and implementing a solution 
- I plan on generating a PDF on MySiddur and getting into knowing how to make a somewhat useful Siddur.
