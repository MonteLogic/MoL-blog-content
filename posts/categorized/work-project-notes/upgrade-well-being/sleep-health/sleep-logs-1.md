Okay, 

What I would like to do is have a gummy which reduces stress which I would take during half of the day. 

Also, taking a gummy is 5x better than taking a pill because it's easier to take, thus you take it more often. 

So, take the sleep aid gummy which doesn't have melatonin and then go to sleep and then take it again once you wake up. 



You should REALLY focus on getting a totally blacked out room and if you can't do that then get a sleep tent.

Also, 

if you have a good stack which just increases your brain activity you won't need to take as much caffeine.
