Okay, so here's the answer. 

Okay, the Passport Bro isn't the answer because at the end of they are still Western women irregardless if you settle where she's at or bring her to the West. 

Islam could help but show me a country where >50% of the pop. is Muslim and their isn't great internal struggle, the marjority of the countries have such issues. 

I would say the answer is to believe in God and have the woman internalize truths which keep families together. 

For this you would benefit in Countries which are stubbornly religous I think that there's something in the DNA which makes people religous. 


I would say these places would be Israel, USA (I know) and ZA (South Africa). With South Africa, I would say I'm the least experienced in. 


You would esp. want to stay away from Eastern Europe. As much as those people would like to Virtue Signal that they are religous the lasting irregilozing legacy of the Soviet Union still haunts them to this day. 

So, you would have an easier time finding a Church girl or Shul girl in Britain than you would in Eastern Europe. 

And I know when I bring this up, I'm undoubtedly met with the archetype of the grifting Church girl or Shul girl but I'm going to give you some indicators to tell which ones are grifitng.
