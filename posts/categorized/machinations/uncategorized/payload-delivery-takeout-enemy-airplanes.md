I've been plotting on ideas to deliver ordinances to enemy planes deep beyond the frontlines.

What is the limiting factor to why a balloon drone ship can't travel hundreds of kilometers?

How about we have a system which maps the geological data of Russia in real time.

So, how about a glider which is trained on the data of the ground, and released and thru that it can discern where it is.

We need to be able to detonate it,

So, a glider which flies autonomously, and is dropped from say, 5,000 meters. 

Then piloted autonomously to the target.


I think there should be a variation where you can hover it to the target in case they start putting it in concrete bunkers.

Ideally there would be a mothership using something like Starlink.

First, we make those drop balloon things and then eventually trans

Ideally we could just make a scheme where it's like the FPV drones where they lay and wait for the right opportunity. 

The link between the video link between the pilot is the thing which takes a lot of battery.

I think the best thing would be an airship drone which goes over the territory, drops munitions and returns to the sender. 

The munitions dropped could be dropped autonomously.
