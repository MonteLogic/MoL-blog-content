It would be great if there was a app which you could pipe really good Gemini / great LLM answers into a app which runs it as a Podcast, really good mixing, etc. 

You may also be able to export episodes, but really it's about personalized podcasts so you don't have to go through the learner's issue of hearing STUFF you ALREADY KNOW!

I don't feel like what is being clogged up in a lot of those repos is technical difficulty but slow bureaucracy and/or lack of communication.
