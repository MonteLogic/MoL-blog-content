It would be great if there was a app which you could pipe really good Gemini / great LLM answers into a app which runs it as a Podcast, really good mixing, etc. 

You may also be able to export episodes, but really it's about personalized podcasts so you don't have to go through the learner's issue of hearing STUFF you ALREADY KNOW!

I don't feel like what is being clogged up in a lot of those repos is technical difficulty but slow bureaucracy and/or lack of communication. 

Or just creative or creative solutions which implies the missing data.

Really what we need to do is mock the setup 

and ig in the background we can have a machine 


but whenever an action happens we need to list everything that happens but it also needs to be in a detailed view.

So we need to have like a mock setup of where it's at also we would include everything we know about the app at that specific time and then when it goes onto the next process we get the intermediary action info and then we list in detail where it's currently at in it's current state, similar to how we would in the first step. 

and then we can have mobile view and desktop view

Ideally, you wouldn't need replay.io but in the end for tricky bugs it is not feasible to not need a debugger like this.



But the trick is to not code in a way which you constantly need this tool.

I think I'm going to use Odin for the Factory Manager which is an LLM-VIZ adaptation.

I should make a checklist sort of web app which will account for every 'base' which needs to be covered in order to have the most exquisite brain activity.
