I feel like if you do what that Mormon dude (Kent C. Dodds) did as far as documenting the decisions you do and why you do them or why THEY did them would be a good piece of value to a repo.

Like, WHY did Expensify make a custom state manager, assumingly there wasn't a state manager on the market which could fill the stated roll but what if there is one today....

Another aside: I feel like there is an easier way to sync environments between two laptops without using a VM or having to worry about booting ISOs and all that, really just a command line.

... 

Aside: I wish there was an easy way to test out the thousands of stacks in a certain use case to experiment to know which one fits the use case the best.


Aside: I would like to turn off ctrl+shift+v for VS Code as it messes with my Vim stuff. 

Aside: Native speech to text functionality for Ubuntu, oy vey would I like this, and have it be seamless, oy. Would have to make the drivers fast. 


Aside: What I would do to have a sort of history of things I select and use as sort of my quick copy and paste, it would be dope if you could press a number and then hit the wheel toggle and it would be nth one of which was in the history of the selections. 


Aside: A way for knowing what you already know would be for the Custom Podcaster to examine the codebase and commit history you have and then it will know what you do and don't know.
