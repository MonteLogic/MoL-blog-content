I'm doing good things with UI overhaul, I still got some work to do, I would like the most popular posts to be displayed more. 

I also, have loads of work to do as far optimizing the prod. environment for speed an UI/UX. 

Also, the build process should act as a lint process and reject builds which have errors in the .md post formatting. 

Every project should have a description.md file describing the project.
