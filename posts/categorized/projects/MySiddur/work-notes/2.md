# Transferring to a CSharp/WASI backend. 

## Start: 2025-12-21 18:43:01 GMT

Ok so we are going to have a better backend to calculate these Hebrew PDFs because it's just taking way too much effort to put a small effort I think this is a limitation of Next.js and Node.js backends they aren't designed for 50k+ lines repos. 

So we send a POST request to this CSharp/WASI backend and we get returned a fully functioning customized PDF. 

We still want to keep the Next.js it's **Exceedingly** good at just starting fast, with payment gateways, also Vercel deployment system is bar-none the easiest deployment xp for a solo dev.

Okay, I ran into a wall in the fact that the WASI/CSharp app I tried to build is bugged out on Linux and won't even run unless the LLVM bug is fixed. 

So I ordered some new Ram for my laptop, so the goal is to get the RAM install a Windows VM and do the dev stuff on the Windows VM and also use WSL. 

In the meantime, I'm going to learn more about CSharp and the WASI infra.
