Current split:


## Monday: Top Speed & Explosive Force

Goal: CNS stimulation and max velocity (100m focus).


### Monday Morning (Willy’s Track): Max Velocity

Warm-up: Dynamic drills (A-skips, B-skips, Prime times) \+ 3x30m build-ups.

Fly 20s: 3–4 runs. (20m build-in at 90%, then 20m at 100% effort). Rest: 4–5 mins.

Speed Endurance: 2 x 150m @ 95% effort. Rest: 8 mins. 

### Monday Afternoon (Gym): Power Output

Banded Hack Squat: 4 x 5 reps. Focus on a controlled 2-second descent and an explosive upward drive to fight the band tension.

Heavy RDLs: 3 x 6\. Focus on a slow stretch of the hamstrings.

Tib Raises \+ Calf Raises: 3 x 15 (as a superset).

## Wednesday: Special Endurance (The 400m "Fix")

Goal: Learn to maintain speed when the "burn" (lactic acid) hits.
## Wednesday Morning: Special Endurance (The 400m "Fix")

Morning (Track): Event Specificity

The "Split 400": 1 x (300m \+ 100m).

Run 300m at your 400m race pace.

Rest exactly 60 seconds.

Sprint the final 100m all-out.

Recovery: 15 minutes full rest/walk.

Finish: 1 x 200m at 95% effort.

Note: This replaces your 600s. It is significantly more intense and trains the specific "gassing out" phase of the 400m.

## Wednesday Afternoon (Gym): Single-Leg Power

Keiser Bulgarian Split Squat: 3 x 6 per leg. (Keep using the Keiser here for that smooth power tracking).

Keiser Quad Extensions: 3 x 10\.

Tib Raises: 3 x 20\.

## Friday: Acceleration & Intensive Tempo  
Goal: Improve the "start" for both events and build a "buffer" for the 400m.

### Friday Morning (Track): Acceleration & Capacity

Sled Pulls: 4 x 30m (Heavy/Moderate). Focus on driving the ground away behind you.

40m Sprints: 4 x 40m (Unresisted). Focus on a low, powerful "piston" drive.

Intensive Tempo: 3 x 200m @ 85% effort. Rest: 3 mins.

Note: These 200s replace the 600s to build aerobic capacity without ruining your sprint mechanics.

### Friday Afternoon (Gym): Heavy Posterior Load

Heavy RDLs: 4 x 5\. (Your main hamstring strength builder for the week).

Banded Hack Squat: 3 x 8\. Use slightly lighter plates but keep the bands for velocity. Knee Sleeves and Weightlifting Belt. 

Tib Raises \+ Calf Raises: 3 x 15\.



I wanna do rhe weighted step machine and heavy RDLS 3x a week. 

Friday go in with Full Wraps 

I wanna do a do over on the Squatmax MD, I know its tough to reach depth but if you load it with bands it may be easier to reach a parallel depth. 

But even if I do do SquatMax I’ll def do Keiser Leg Extensions on the same day.   



### Friday Afternoon:

Calf raises on the Keiser Leg Press

RDL first not heavy but just to get Hamstrings and Back worked.

The going into Hack Squat
so in With Full Wraps. 


Notes:

On Monday and Wednesday mornings, do not rush your sets. If you aren't recovered, you aren't training speed; you're training "slow."
