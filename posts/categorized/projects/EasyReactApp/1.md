We should make a sort of running lists of React Frameworks supported. 



I know CRACO will be supported, we have to get Vite to work too.

This shouldn't be in the public dir as it's generated 
public/test-status-viewer.html.

Really, it should be in like testing-results dir.

Aside: It would be dope if you could write code against Chess Positions, I feel like that would be a good warm-up.


... 

I should put the RAM I bought into my laptop in but I'm starting to think buying 100 dollars worth of DDR4 RAM was an inaccuracy because it may have been better to save up Money and buy a much  faster computer with 18gb of DDR5 ram. 



Okay, with the ERA App, we need Monte's Testing Suite. 

It could be like a package, you download it and you get the testing Suite. 

And really what I should do is make my Chess game and host on the ERA. 

But REALLY, I could rewrite that Resume maker as a SPA and put it on the ERA.
