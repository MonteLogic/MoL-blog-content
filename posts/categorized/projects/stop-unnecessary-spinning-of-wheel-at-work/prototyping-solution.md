## Getting bearings
I'm unsure how to even prototype this, so lets get an answer from Gemini. 

## Henceforth
I feel like I should make that WorldLabs walk throuugh thing and then import it to like a 3D engine (which is Rust or GoLang based) but is very performant. 

## Today: 02.18.2026
Okay, so we are going to use these 3d based tools and go from there because it will make it A LOT easier to solve recursively with tools like Antigravity because there's an embeded browser in Antigravity

### Tooling

We are going to use tools like
