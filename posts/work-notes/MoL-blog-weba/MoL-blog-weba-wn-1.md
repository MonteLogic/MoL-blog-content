I like this component-sets idea for the .mdx.

I am currently trying to compose, 'ui/address-bar.tsx' into smaller components.

The problem is if I don't have the .env vars for Stripe, it may trigger a false negative.

So the TaskBar needs to have the Stripe logic isolated and if the .env is not there than take out that part without triggering a false negative.

Okay, got that finished in the #5 issue, which is kind of going over scope. 

... Okay so no remark plugins, see (here)[https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote/issues/375].

Currently, I don't know where exactly I was at with my last session, what was my last commit, what was I doing etc? 

So, I think a good way to get around this is to have a filter feature on the blog, then I can just use the arrow toggle to see which one was the last updated and which one was first published first, etc.
